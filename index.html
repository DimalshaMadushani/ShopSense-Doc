            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>
              Many people keep to-buy lists, but they often forget to check them
              when it matters. You might pass a shop that sells an item you need
              and only remember it later at home. This leads to missed tasks and
              extra trips. Most reminder apps work by time, not by location, so
              they cannot help at the right moment.
            </p>

          <div class="overview-card">
            <h3>The ShopSense solution</h3>
            <p>
              ShopSense gives smart, location based reminders. You create a
              to-buy list, set your home location, and turn on Shopping Mode
              when heading out. The app quietly checks nearby stores that match
              your list and alerts you when you are close to a useful shop. You
              can control reminder frequency so notifications stay timely and
              manageable.
