# ShopSense Documentation Website

This repository contains the documentation site for **ShopSense**, a mobile app that helps users remember what to buy at the right place and time through simple, location-based shopping reminders.

The website explains:
- How the app works

The guide is designed with a clean layout to make the instructions easy to follow.
